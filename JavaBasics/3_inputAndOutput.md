## Input and Output in Java

### Scanner Class

Scanner is a class in java.util package used for obtaining the input of the primitive types like int, double, etc. and strings. It is the easiest way to read input in a Java program, though not very efficient if you want an input method for scenarios where time is a constraint like in competitive programming.

1. To create an object of Scanner class, we usually pass the predefined object System.in, which represents the standard input stream. We may pass an object of class File if we want to read input from a file.
2. To read numerical values of a certain data type XYZ, the function to use is nextXYZ(). For example, to read a value of type short, we can use nextShort()
3. To read strings, we use nextLine().
4. To read a single character, we use next().charAt(0). next() function returns the next token/word in the input as a string and charAt(0) function returns the first character in that string.
5. The Scanner class reads an entire line and divides the line into tokens. Tokens are small elements that have some meaning to the Java compiler. For example, Suppose there is an input string: How are you
6. In this case, the scanner object will read the entire line and divides the string into tokens: "How", "are" and "you". The object then iterates over each token and reads each token using its different methods.

Sometimes, we have to check if the next value we read is of a certain type or if the input has ended (EOF marker encountered).

Then, we check if the scanner's input is of the type we want with the help of **hasNextXYZ()** functions where XYZ is the type we are interested in. The function returns true if the scanner has a token of that type, otherwise false. For example, in the below code, we have used hasNextInt(). To check for a string, we use hasNextLine(). Similarly, to check for a single character, we use **hasNext().charAt(0)**.

Let us look at the code snippet to read some numbers from console and print their mean. 

```java
// Java program to read some values using Scanner
// class and print their mean.
import java.util.Scanner;

  public class GfG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare an object and initialize with
        // predefined standard input object
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Initialize sum and count of input elements
        int sum = 0, count = 0;

        // Check if an int value is available
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            // Read an int value
            int num = sc.nextInt();
            sum += num;
            count++;
        }
        int mean = sum / count;
        System.out.println("Mean: " + mean);
    }
}
```
Input:
101
223
238
892
99
500
728

Output:
Mean: 397

### Character Stream VS Byte Stream

A stream is a sequence of data. I/O Stream refers to a stream that is unlikely a method to sequentially access a file. I/O Stream means an input source or output destination representing different types of sources e.g. disk files. The java.io package provides classes that allow you to convert between Unicode character streams and byte streams of non-Unicode text.

Input Stream: reads data from the source. 
Output Stream: writes data to a destination. 

When to use Character Stream over Byte Stream?

In Java, characters are stored using Unicode conventions. Character stream is useful when we want to process text files. These text files can be processed character by character. Character size is typically 16 bits.

When to use Byte Stream over Character Stream?  

Byte oriented reads byte by byte.  A byte stream is suitable for processing raw data like binary files.

### Buffered Reader and Scanner
Major Differences between Scanner and BufferedReader Class in Java

BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. BufferedReader should be used if we are working with multiple threads.
BufferedReader has a significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.
The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but it's more than enough.
BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because the scanner does the parsing of input data and BufferedReader simply reads a sequence of characters.


### Ways to take Input in Java
1. Using Buffered Reader Class

This is the Java classical method to take input, Introduced in JDK 1.0. This method is used by wrapping the System.in (standard input stream) in an InputStreamReader which is wrapped in a BufferedReader, we can read input from the user in the command line. 

The input is buffered for efficient reading.
The wrapping code is hard to remember.

Implementation:

```java
// Java program to demonstrate BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws IOException
    {
        // Enter data using BufferReader
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
            new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        // Reading data using readLine
        String name = reader.readLine();

        // Printing the read line
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```

Input: 

Geek
Output: 

Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Geek
Note: 

To read other types, we use functions like Integer.parseInt(), Double.parseDouble(). To read multiple values, we use split(). 

2. Using Scanner Class

This is probably the most preferred method to take input. The main purpose of the Scanner class is to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions, however, it is also can be used to read input from the user in the command line. 

Convenient methods for parsing primitives (nextInt(), nextFloat(), â€¦) from the tokenized input.
Regular expressions can be used to find tokens.
The reading methods are not synchronized
To see more differences, please see this article.

```java
// Java program to demonstrate working of Scanner in Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GetInputFromUser {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // Using Scanner for Getting Input from User
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        String s = in.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered string " + s);

        int a = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered integer " + a);

        float b = in.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("You entered float " + b);
    }
}
```

Input: 

GeeksforGeeks
12
3.4
Output:

You entered string GeeksforGeeks
You entered integer 12
You entered float 3.4

### Fast I/O in Java in Competitive Programming

Using Java in competitive programming is not something many people would suggest just because of its slow input and output, and well indeed it is slow.

In this article, we have discussed some ways to get around the difficulty and change the verdict from TLE to (in most cases) AC.

Example:

Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11
Output: 
4

1. Scanner Class (easy, less typing, but not recommended very slow, refer this for reasons of slowness): 

In most of the cases, we get TLE while using scanner class. It uses built-in nextInt(), nextLong(), nextDouble methods to read the desired object after initiating scanner object with the input stream(e.g. System.in). The following program many times gets time limit exceeded verdict and therefore not of much use.

```java
// Working program using Scanner
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class GfG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = s.nextInt();
        int k = s.nextInt();
        int count = 0;
        while (n-- > 0) {
            int x = s.nextInt();
            if (x % k == 0)
                count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

2. BufferedReader (fast, but not recommended as it requires a lot of typing):  

The Java.io.BufferedReader class reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. With this method, we will have to parse the value every time for the desired type. Reading multiple words from a single line adds to its complexity because of the use of Stringtokenizer and hence this is not recommended. These get accepted with a running time of approx. 0.89s but still as you can see it requires a lot of typing altogether and therefore method 3 is recommended. 
 

```java
// Working program using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class GfG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws IOException {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(
            new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        StringTokenizer st
            = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int count = 0;
        while (n-- > 0) {
            int x = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
            if (x % k == 0)
                count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

3. User-defined FastReader Class (which uses bufferedReader and StringTokenizer):  

This method uses the time advantage of BufferedReader and StringTokenizer and the advantage of user-defined methods for less typing and therefore a faster input altogether. These get accepted with a time of 1.23 s and this method is very much recommended as it is easy to remember and is fast enough to meet the needs of most of the question in competitive coding.
 
```java
// Working program with FastReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class GfG {
    static class FastReader {
        BufferedReader br;
        StringTokenizer st;

        public FastReader() {
            br = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        }

        String next() {
            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {
                try {
                    st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
                }
                catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            return st.nextToken();
        }

        int nextInt() { return Integer.parseInt(next()); }

        long nextLong() { return Long.parseLong(next()); }

        double nextDouble() {
            return Double.parseDouble(next());
        }

        String nextLine() {
            String str = "";
            try {
                if (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
                    str = st.nextToken("\n");
                }
                else {
                    str = br.readLine();
                }
            }
            catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return str;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FastReader s = new FastReader();
        int n = s.nextInt();
        int k = s.nextInt();
        int count = 0;
        while (n-- > 0) {
            int x = s.nextInt();
            if (x % k == 0)
                count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```
4.Using Reader Class:  

There is yet another fast way through the problem, I would say the fastest way but is not recommended since it requires very cumbersome methods in its implementation. It uses inputDataStream to read through the stream of data and uses read() method and nextInt() methods for taking inputs. This is by far the fastest ways of taking input but is difficult to remember and is cumbersome in its approach. Below is the sample program using this method. These get accepted with a surprising time of just 0.28 s. Although this is ultra-fast, it is clearly not an easy method to remember.

```java
// Working program using Reader Class
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

    static class Reader {
        final private int BUFFER_SIZE = 1 << 16;
        private DataInputStream din;
        private byte[] buffer;
        private int bufferPointer, bytesRead;

        public Reader()
        {
            din = new DataInputStream(System.in);
            buffer = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
            bufferPointer = bytesRead = 0;
        }

        public Reader(String file_name) throws IOException
        {
            din = new DataInputStream(
                new FileInputStream(file_name));

                    }
                }
                buf[cnt++] = (byte)c;
