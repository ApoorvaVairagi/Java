```java
class Main {
    
    public static int binarySearch(int arr[], int s, int e, int element)
    {
        if (s>e)
            return -1;
        
        int mid = (s+e)/2;
        
        if(arr[mid]>element){
            return binarySearch(arr, s, mid-1, element);
        }
        else if(arr[mid]<element){
            return binarySearch(arr, mid+1, e, element);
        }
        else
            return mid;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 45, 67, 78, 79, 89};
        int s = 0;
        int e = arr.length;
        int element = 67;
    
        System.out.println(binarySearch(arr, s, e, element));
    }
}
```

This recursion is tail recursion because:
- The recursive calls to binarySearch are the last operations in their respective branches.
- Thereâ€™s no further computation after the recursive call before returning.

### Comparision of Iterative and Recursive Approach.
**Time Complexity**: Both iterative and recursive approaches have O(log n) time complexity.

**Auxiliary Space Complexity**:
- Iterative: O(1) (constant space)
- Recursive: O(log n) (due to call stack space for recursion)
Additional Notes: Recursive approach uses extra stack space which might lead to overhead, whereas iterative approach is more memory-efficient.
